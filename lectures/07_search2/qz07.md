Below is an implementation of phase calculation for a board in Rust.
However, something might be wrong with it.
What's wrong?

```rust
/// Calculate the phase of a position.
/// Will return 1.0 in the case that the game is a full midgame, and 0.0 if it is a full endgame.
/// Will return a number in between if it is in between in phase.
fn phase_of(b: &Board) -> f32 {
    if b.material() > LEAST_MIDGAME_MATERIAL {
        1.0
    } else if b.material() < MOST_ENDGAME_MATERIAL {
        0.0
    } else {
        (b.material() - LEAST_MIDGAME_MATERIAL) as f32
        / (MOST_ENDGAME_MATERIAL - LEAST_MIDGAME_MATERIAL) as f32
    }
}
```

- [x] It returns the wrong blending (i.e. 0.0 for midgame and 1.0 for endgame).
- [ ] It returns values of the wrong sign (i.e. negative values).
- [ ] It rounds to the nearest integer.
- [ ] Nothing is wrong with it.
