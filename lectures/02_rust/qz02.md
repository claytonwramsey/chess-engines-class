Tammy wants to be able to let a function access her `Vec` without losing control over it.
She tried writing the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    give_me_access(v);
    println!("v is {:?}", v);
}

fn give_me_access(v: Vec<u32>) {
    println!("v has {} elements!", v.len());
}
```

However, the compiler gives her an error because the value of `v` has been moved.
What can Tammy do to fix this?

- [x] Pass `v` by immutable reference.
- [ ] Give up and switch to C++.
- [ ] Overwrite `v` to be a new `Vec` after it gets moved.
- [ ] Disable the borrow checker by compiling the code with the flag `-Zno_borrow_checker`.

Overall, how comfortable do you feel about writing small pieces of code (~10-25 lines) in Rust?
Any answer is correct.

- [x] I would struggle severely and it would take me many hours.
- [x] I would likely have to read some documentation and experiment a little, but I could do it on
      my own.
- [x] I would have no trouble at all.
- [x] I'm bored.
      Give me harder homeworks.
