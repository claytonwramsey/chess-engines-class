# COLL 110: Quiz 3 - Move generation

---

Your friend has written the following code to print out the set of captures that can be made by
pawns (excluding en passant), but they tell you it's not working.
What's wrong with the code below?
You may assume that any code not present (such as `opposite()` and `by_color()` is correct).

```rust
const PAWN_ATTACKS: [Bitboard; 64] = /* blah blah blah */;

fn print_pawn_captures(b: &Board) {
    let us = b.player; // the player to move
    let them = us.opposite(); // the opposing side

    // iterate over all squares occupied by pawns on our side
    for from_sq in b.by_color(us) & b.by_type(Piece::Pawn) {

        // look up the squares that a pawn on `from_sq` can see
        let attacks = PAWN_ATTACKS[from_sq];

        // generate moves and print them out
        for to_sq in attacks {
            let my_move = Move::new(from_sq, to_sq);
            println!("{my_move}");
        }
    }
}
```

- [x] The code uses the same attacks lookup table for white pawns and black pawns.

- [ ] The code has mixed up its from- and to- squares.

- [ ] The code might look up squares out of bounds if there are no pawns on the board.

- [ ] The code has to look up pawn attacks for the opposing side's pawns.

Referring to the code from question 1, what would be a good way to resolve the error in the code?
Select all that apply.

- [x] Create two independent lookup tables for pawn attacks from either player.

- [x] Alter the index used to look up pawn attacks based on the color of the player to move.

- [ ] Swap the definitions for `from_sq` and `to_sq`.

- [ ] Include en passant.

How was homework 1 for you?
All answers are correct.

- [x] too easy

- [x] it was ok i guess

- [x] very hard

- [x] i didn't even finish
