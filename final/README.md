# COLL 110 - Final Project

I hope you have learned some interesting things in this class.
It's now your turn to apply what you've learned by implementing a feature on a chess engine.
A simple chess engine, [Tomato](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/tomato), has already been provided
to you, but you can also modify a different chess engine (it need not even be written in Rust).

## Your assignment

For you final project, you must:

1. Fork an existing chess engine (I recommend [Tomato](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/tomato)
   but if you want you can also try [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) or
   [Leela](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0) if you want a challenge).
1. Implement a feature or optimization of your choosing on the engine.
   I've provided a sample menu of possible projects in the attached menu.
1. Benchmark the effects of your change by testing against another engine with Cute Chess.
1. Present your results on the last day of class.

You may work in as large of a group as you like.
Additionally, in line with my academic integrity policy, you may use any materials you like in this
project.

Please include any materials associated with your results (slides, benchmark data, Elo results) in
your assignment repo so I can see it!

### Benchmarking

I recommend using Cute Chess to test your engine against an existing engine (such as the starter
code) to generate an Elo estimate.
However, so long as you have some methodology that yields good results, this is OK.

### Presentation

Your final presentation should be brief (less than 5 minutes).
It should include the following:

- A description of what feature you implemented.
- Your methodology for testing its correctness and/or performance.
- The benchmarking results.

You will present these results on the last day of class.
I will also invite people who have sponsored the course (such as our faculty sponsor, Joe Young) and
maybe bring snacks.

## Grading

This assignment is graded out of 15 points total:

- 5 points: correct implementation of your feature
- 5 points: benchmarked results
- 5 points: presentation

## Alternate option: choose your own adventure

If you'd like to do something of your own (e.g. you want to build a Connect Four engine or build
your own engine from scratch in Lisp, idk), you may do that first, but _only_ if you reach out to
me and get approval first.
