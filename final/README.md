# COLL 110 - Final Project

I hope you have learned some interesting things in this class.
It's now your turn to apply what you've learned by implementing a feature on a chess engine.
A simple chess engine, [Tomato](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/tomato), has already been provided
to you, but you can also modify a different chess engine (it need not even be written in Rust).

## Your assignment

For you final project, you must:

1. Fork an existing chess engine (I recommend [Tomato](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/tomato)
   but if you want you can also try [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) or
   [Leela](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0) if you want a challenge).
1. Implement a feature or optimization of your choosing on the engine. 
    I've provided a sample menu of possible
